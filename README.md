# Connect4
A connect 4 AI implemented using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Difficulty is customizable and correlates directly to tree depth in the minimax algorithm. A script is provided that allows two AIs to be pitted against one another.

Further improvements to implement:
- Improved heuristic function
- Caching of boards
- Using bits to represent the board
- Implementing in a faster language such as C
